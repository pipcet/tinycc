Provides: c-compiler
Description: small ANSI C compiler
 TCC (for Tiny C Compiler) is a small and fast ANSI C compiler.  It
 generates optimized x86 code, and can compile, assemble, and link
 several times faster than 'gcc -O0'.  Any C dynamic library can be used
 directly.  It includes an optional memory and bounds checker, and
 bounds-checked code can be mixed freely with standard code.  C script
 is also supported via the usual hash-bang mechanism.
 .
 NOTE: TCC is still somewhat experimental and is not recommended for
 production use.  The code it generates is much less optimized than what
 GCC produces, and compiler bugs can have serious security consequences
 for your program.

Description: fast library for dynamic code generation
 Libtcc is a library that uses tcc, a compiler several times faster than
 'gcc -O0' to perform dynamic code generation. It exposes in its API all
 operations tcc performs to generate a binary from sources: setting
 header and library paths, compiling program from a source file,
 manipulating its symbols and handling relocation of its code among
 other things. Libtcc is also able to compile from a buffer.
 .
 This package contains the static library and header file for TCC (Tiny
 C Compiler).

 NOTE: libtcc is still somewhat experimental and is not recommended for
 production use.  The code it generates is much less optimized than what
 GCC produces, and compiler bugs can have serious security consequences
 for your program.
