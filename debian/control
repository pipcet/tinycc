Description: the smallest ANSI C compiler
 TCC (for Tiny C Compiler) is a small and fast ANSI C compiler.  It
 generates optimized x86 code, and can compile, assemble, and link
 several times faster than 'gcc -O0'.  Any C dynamic library can be used
 directly.  It includes an optional memory and bounds checker, and
 bounds-checked code can be mixed freely with standard code.  C script
 is also supported via the usual hash-bang mechanism.
 .
 NOTE: TCC is still somewhat experimental and is not recommended for
 production use.  The code it generates is much less optimized than what
 GCC produces, and compiler bugs can have serious security consequences
 for your program.
